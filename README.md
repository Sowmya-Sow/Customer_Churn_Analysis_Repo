This project builds a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn and uncover the key factors driving customer loss. Using Python for data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and model training and Power BI for interactive visual insights the solution combines both technical rigor and business relevance.

⭐The workflow includes:

Preprocessing & cleaning the Telco Customer dataset

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior

Feature engineering (tenure grouping, one-hot encoding)

Model training using a Random Forest classifier

Evaluating model performance and extracting feature importance

Generating churn probability scores for all customers

Building a Power BI dashboard to visualize churn patterns and risk segments

⭐The final deliverables include:

A trained machine learning model

Churn probability scores for each customer

Feature importance insights showing the strongest churn predictors

A multi-page Power BI report illustrating customer behavior, churn trends, and actionable insights

🎯 Key Insights from the Analysis

Month-to-month contract customers have the highest churn rate, indicating low long-term commitment and higher risk.

Customers with longer tenure are significantly less likely to churn, suggesting loyalty improves over time.

Higher monthly charges correlate strongly with churn, meaning price-sensitive customers are more likely to leave.

Automatic payment methods are associated with lower churn, highlighting the role of payment convenience in retention.

These insights help businesses understand which customer segments need attention and what strategies can reduce churn.
